# 2D-n-body-simulation
Simple toy n-body simulation written in C++ using the SFML library. Calculations are done using a first order leapfrog integrator, which guarantees that the simulation is symplectic . This implementation is a naÃ¯ve force-sum simulation, and is thus unsuitable for a large number particles (i.e. n > 1000); for these problems a method such as the Barnes-Hut algorithm or fast-multipole expansion would be preferable. 

Hardware accelerated version of original project. Performs the leapfrog integration using an OpenCL kernel rather than the previous single threaded implementation. This provides the benefit of highly parallelized force compuatation but at the expense of hardware latency and overhead. This makes it a good fit for larger numbers of particles, however the overhead restricts how many substeps can be calculated in each frame. This makes it far less suitable for lengthy simulations involving lower numbers of particles (n < ~800).
